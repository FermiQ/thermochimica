# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
While the primary purpose of Thermochimica is to be used within multi-physics applications, stand-alone calculations are also supported. Four GUIs are provided to assist with setting up, running, and plotting data from stand-alone Thermochimica calculations. These are: 

- [`thermoGUI`](#`thermoGUI`), which performs simple calculations or loops over calculations, 
- [`plotGUI`](#`plotGUI`), which can generate plots of many parameters calculated by Thermochimica
- [`phaseDiagramGUI`](#`phaseDiagramGUI`), which creates binary phase diagrams, and
- [`pseudoBinaryPhaseDiagramGUI`](#`pseudoBinaryPhaseDiagramGUI`), which creates phase diagrams in which the endpoints are compounds rather than individual elements.

Each GUI is documented below. Installation instructions are available in the main [Thermochimica readme](https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/thermochimica#method-3-guis). A shell script to start each GUI is available in the `scripts` directory. From the root Thermochimica directory, simply run (for example):
```bash
./scripts/thermoGUI.sh
```
These scripts (except for `plotGUI.sh`) build Thermochimica before launching the selected GUI, so may take a few seconds to start when used for the first time or after changes to the source code.
